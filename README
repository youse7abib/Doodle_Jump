# Doodle Jump Game

A browser-based recreation of the classic Doodle Jump game built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## 📋 Description

This is a simple implementation of the popular Doodle Jump mobile game where players control a character that jumps automatically and must land on platforms to climb higher while avoiding falling off the screen.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Move Left:** Press `A` or `←` (Left Arrow)
- **Move Right:** Press `D` or `→` (Right Arrow)
- **Restart:** Press `Space` when game is over

### Objective
- Keep the doodler jumping on platforms
- Climb as high as possible to increase your score
- Avoid falling off the bottom of the screen

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- The following image assets in an `Assets` folder:
  - `doodlejumpbg.png` - Background image
  - `doodler-right.png` - Character facing right
  - `doodler-left.png` - Character facing left
  - `platform.png` - Platform image

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Ensure you have the following file structure:
```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── main.js
└── Assets/
    ├── doodlejumpbg.png
    ├── doodler-right.png
    ├── doodler-left.png
    └── platform.png
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Game Mechanics

- **Canvas Size:** 360px × 576px
- **Character Size:** 46px × 46px
- **Platform Size:** 60px × 18px
- **Initial Jump Velocity:** -8
- **Gravity:** 0.4
- **Horizontal Movement Speed:** 4

### Features

- Smooth character movement with left/right animations
- Automatic jumping mechanics
- Dynamic platform generation
- Screen wrapping (character reappears on opposite side)
- Score tracking system
- Game over detection
- Restart functionality

## 📝 Code Structure

- **index.html** - Main HTML structure with canvas element
- **style.css** - Basic styling for the game board
- **main.js** - Core game logic including:
  - Game initialization
  - Character movement and physics
  - Platform generation and collision detection
  - Score calculation
  - Game loop

## 🎯 Game Logic

The game uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation and implements:
- Gravity-based physics for jumping
- Collision detection between the doodler and platforms
- Automatic platform scrolling when the doodler reaches 3/4 of the screen height
- Platform recycling system to maintain performance

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Score calculation uses random values which may not reflect actual game progress accurately
- Consider implementing a distance-based scoring system for better gameplay

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add different platform types (moving, breaking, spring platforms)
- Implement power-ups
- Add sound effects and background music
- Create a high score leaderboard
- Add mobile touch controls
- Improve scoring mechanism
